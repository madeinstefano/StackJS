StackJS by Stéfano Stypulkowski

StackJS provides a global object called Stack, which is useful to store values with alias.

In the stack can be stored anything, link object, strings, arrays, numbers, etc.

The stack store all objects stored in it inside his class, providing global access without polluted the namespace.
